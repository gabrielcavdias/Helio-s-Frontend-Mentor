                I still have some problems to resize the image in the right way,
                it will probably need some re-work

                The website of a fictional agency, the mobile menu is not quite what
                i was expecting, but it's good. 
                I will probably come back to this for some small adjustments.

            <p class="project__description">
                It's an usual Todo List, I made it with React as my first project in this technology.
                I still need to implement the drag and drop feature in a future commit.

                The website is a fictional bank/fintech landing page. 
                The project was kind of quick to code and was a good practice
                although the footer is a little bit different than the original design

                The way i structured the filtering caused some blink, because i had to reset the list to its initial state.
                still in need of some improvement
